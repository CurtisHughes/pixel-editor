A web based pixel editor that utilizes the html canvas element to display pixels and handle user input. The goal of this package was provide a minimal interface to the canvas that would allow consumers to create their own tools and UI elements.

### Features
* Undo/Redo
* Mobile/Desktop event handling and pointer positions

### Default Tools
Even though the editor implementation empowers the consumer to create their own tools, the project has included some default tools:
* Pencil
* Rectangle
